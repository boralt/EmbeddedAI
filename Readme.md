# EmbeddedAI    *EmbeddedAI* is a library that provides elements of AI to C++ applications.Due to its small footprint it is usable even for small embedded systems.The initial set of algorithms in this library is based on a Bayesian approach to AI. This library can dramatically simplify implementation of what would otherwise be complicated, custom programming of hard to implement and maintain logic.With a Bayesian approach the results are consistent with an easily visualized model. # Methodology  1. Build Model  2. Apply sample/measurement  3. Query model for inference of non-directly observed variables  4. Query model for decisions based on maximum payoff/lowest loss![model](./docs/model.png)  ## Applications   * Based on observations, determine probabilities of any individual cause or combination of causes    * Find the most likely explanations of any given observation (Minimum Probability of Error MPE)   * Find the most likely values of certain causes given an observation (Maximum Aposteriori Probability MAP)   * Find the optimal sequence of decisions (actions), given costs (payoffs)     and observations performed prior to any actionDoxygen pages of Library Components can be viewed [here](https://rawgit.com/boralt/EmbeddedAI/master/api/html/classes.html)## APIThe project [Wiki](https://github.com/boralt/EmbeddedAI/wiki) contains brief API information.
